The search engine can be accessed by running searchCLI from the terminal. Because this implementation doesn't store the search index, it can only search a limited scope, starting from the site specified in executeSearch. The spider uses the parameters "crawlDepth" and "crawlBreadth" to control how thorough the search will be: the latter decides how many of the links the spider will check each time it crawls, and the former decides how many iterations it will go through.
